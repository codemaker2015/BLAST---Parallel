/**
 * Class DefaultAlignmentStats provides an object that computes
 * statistics of an {@linkplain Alignment}. Methods are provided to compute the
 * raw score, the bit score, and the <I>E</I>-value. The formulas for these
 * statistics assume that the alignment:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>
 * is for two protein sequences,
 * <LI>
 * was calculated by the Smith-Waterman local alignment algorithm,
 * <LI>
 * using the BLOSUM-62 protein substitution matrix,
 * <LI>
 * using a gap existence penalty of &minus;11 and a gap extension penalty of
 * &minus;1,
 * <LI>
 * matching a query sequence against a database of subject sequences, where the
 * sum of the subject sequence lengths is supplied as a constructor parameter.
 * </UL>
 * <P>
 * The formulas for the bit score and <I>E</I>-value are:
 * <CENTER>
 * <I>S</I>' = (<I>&lambda;</I> <I>S</I> &minus; ln <I>K</I>)/(ln 2)
 * <BR>
 * <I>E</I> = <I>K</I> <I>m</I> <I>n</I> exp(&minus;<I>&lambda;</I> <I>S</I>)
 * </CENTER>
 * where <I>S</I> is the raw score, <I>m</I> is the query sequence length,
 * <I>n</I> is the total subject sequence length, and the parameters are
 * <I>K</I> = 0.035, <I>&lambda;</I> = 0.252.
 * <P>
 * These formulas were taken from:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>
